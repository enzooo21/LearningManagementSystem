## Learning Management System for Agricultural Training and Advisory Service
Welcome to the Learning Management System designed to support and enhance farm business advisory services through a robust digital platform. This system is specifically developed for the International Training Center on Pig Husbandry, a leading institution in livestock-focused agricultural training.

The LMS aims to streamline the delivery of educational content, manage training programs, and improve the overall efficiency of data handling and tracking within the advisory and training ecosystem. By integrating modern database systems and user-centered design, the platform empowers trainers, farmers, and advisors to connect, learn, and collaborate more effectively.

## Future Improvements 
We have exciting plans to make this Learning Management System even more useful and accessible in the future. One of our top priorities is to make the system easier to use on mobile devices. This will help farmers and trainees who may not have access to computers but do use smartphones. We’re also planning to add support for multiple languages, so people from different countries and regions can use the system in the language they’re most comfortable with.

In the future, we’d like to introduce smart features powered by artificial intelligence. These could help answer common questions automatically and offer helpful suggestions for farm business decisions. We’re also exploring an offline mode, so users can download lessons and access them without needing the internet all the time.

To help trainers and administrators track progress, we plan to build a dashboard that shows how learners are doing and how effective the training is. We also want to add quizzes, tests, and certificates to reward learners for completing training programs.

Other features we’re looking forward to include live chat support, where users can ask questions and get help directly from advisors, and personal profiles where users can see their training history and progress. Finally, we hope to connect our system with official agricultural databases so that the information we provide is always up-to-date and reliable.
